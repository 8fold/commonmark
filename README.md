**league/commonmark** is a highly-extensible PHP Markdown parser created by [Colin O'Dell][@colinodell] which supports the full [CommonMark] spec.  It is based on the [CommonMark JS reference implementation][commonmark.js] by [John MacFarlane] \([@jgm]\).

## üì¶ Installation & Basic Usage

This project can be installed via [Composer]:

``` bash
$ composer require league/commonmark:^0.19
```

The `CommonMarkConverter` class provides a simple wrapper for converting CommonMark to HTML:

```php
use League\CommonMark\CommonMarkConverter;

$converter = new CommonMarkConverter([
    'html_input' => 'strip',
    'allow_unsafe_links' => false,
]);

echo $converter->convertToHtml('# Hello World!');

// <h1>Hello World!</h1>
```

Please note that only UTF-8 and ASCII encodings are supported.  If your Markdown uses a different encoding please convert it to UTF-8 before running it through this library.

üîí If you will be parsing untrusted input from users, please consider setting the `html_input` and `allow_unsafe_links` options per the example above. See <https://commonmark.thephpleague.com/security/> for more details. If you also do choose to allow raw HTML input from untrusted users, considering using a library (like [HTML Purifier](https://github.com/ezyang/htmlpurifier)) to provide additional HTML filtering.

## üè∑Ô∏è Versioning

[SemVer](http://semver.org/) is followed closely.  0.x.0 versions will introduce breaking changes to the codebase, so be careful which version constraints you use. **It's highly recommended that you use [Composer's caret operator](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/versions.md#caret) to ensure compatibility**; for example: `^0.18`.  This is equivalent to `>=0.18.0 <0.19.0`.

0.x.y releases should not introduce breaking changes to the codebase; however, they might change the resulting AST or HTML output of parsed Markdown (due to bug fixes, spec changes, etc.)  As a result, you might get slightly different HTML, but any custom code built onto this library should still function correctly.

If you're only using the `CommonMarkConverter` class or `ConverterInterface` to convert Markdown (no other class references, custom parsers, etc.), then it should be safe to use a broader constraint like `~0.18`, `>0.18`, etc.  I personally promise to never break this specific class in any future 0.x or 1.0 release.

## üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Contributing

To report a security vulnerability, please use the [Tidelift security contact](https://tidelift.com/security). Tidelift will coordinate the fix and disclosure with us.

If you encounter a bug in the spec, please report it to the [CommonMark] project.  Any resulting fix will eventually be implemented in this project as well.

Contributions to this library are **welcome**, especially ones that:

 * Improve usability or flexibility without compromising our ability to adhere to the [CommonMark spec]
 * Mirror fixes made to the [reference implementation][commonmark.js]
 * Optimize performance
 * Fix issues with adhering to the [CommonMark spec]

Major refactoring to core parsing logic should be avoided if possible so that we can easily follow updates made to [the reference implementation][commonmark.js]. That being said, we will absolutely consider changes which don't deviate too far from the reference spec or which are favored by other popular CommonMark implementations.

Please see [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/thephpleague/commonmark/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for additional details.

## üß™ Testing

``` bash
$ composer test
```

This will also test league/commonmark against the latest supported spec.

## üöÄ Performance Benchmarks

You can compare the performance of **league/commonmark** to other popular parsers by running the included benchmark tool:

``` bash
$ ./tests/benchmark/benchmark.php
```
